# UbiquitiUtils - Utilities for Ubiquiti devices
Brass tax - This is a repository of utility scripts for dealing with Ubiquiti devices.

## What's the point?
This is primarily for scenarios which are (at least in my opinion) more difficult than they should be to deal with.

Ubiquiti has done a decent job of making *some* things easy enough to do from the GUI, but there's a number of things that just don't seem to get the same love and have to be done by cracking open the 'ol command line. That's where this starts to come in. 

In particular, if there's a scenario that seems like it may need to be repeated on a semi-regular basis or a use case that is *common or complicated enough Ubiquiti should really just deal with it but hasn't...* it's something that I'm going to consider storing here. User-friendly operation is key and maybe with some luck you'll find something in here that allows you to do something in an more straightforward, less painful, or just simply more expedient manner.

## Goals
1. Will I probably do this again or need to remember? Should probably consider scripting or automating it. Worst case, just store the knowledge.
1. User-friendly operation - you shouldn't need to be intimately familiar with linux to make use of this stuff, ideally. Stuff should be relatively fault-tolerant and reliable.

# Contributions
This will likely end up as a compedium of things I've encountered - I'm open to contributions, but keep in mind that it is a public repo and others may run it so please make sure you actually put it through the ringer a bit and closely consider the [goals of this repository](#goals). I'm not going to test it for you. If it looks reasonably well written I'll probably accept it on good faith.
